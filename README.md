### Why do we need network slicing?

Network slicing is a technique used to partition a single physical network infrastructure into multiple logical networks, each with its own resources, security, and quality of service (QoS) parameters. Network slicing is used in various scenarios, such as 5G mobile networks, internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing. Here are some reasons why we need network slicing:
1.	Efficient resource utilization: Network slicing allows the sharing of a single physical network infrastructure among multiple logical networks, enabling efficient utilization of network resources. Each network slice can be customized according to its specific requirements, such as bandwidth, latency, and security.
2.	Customized services: Network slicing enables the creation of customized services tailored to specific use cases, such as mobile broadband, smart cities, or autonomous vehicles. Each network slice can be optimized for its intended use case, providing a more efficient and reliable service.
3.	Enhanced security: Network slicing enables the implementation of end-to-end security policies for each network slice, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and preventing unauthorized access.
4.	Improved scalability: Network slicing enables the creation of new logical networks quickly and easily, allowing for improved scalability and flexibility.
5.	QoS management: Network slicing enables the implementation of QoS policies for each network slice, ensuring that the network resources are allocated appropriately based on the specific requirements of each service.
Overall, network slicing is an important technique for enabling efficient and customized network services, improving network scalability, and enhancing security and QoS management.
